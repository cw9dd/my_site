I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin focusing on mobile sensing for mental health. I provide research and data analytics expertise for UT’s [Whole Communities Whole Health](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/whole-communities-whole-health/) grand challenge initiative, a multidisciplinary task force between engineering and behavioral sciences specialized in health sensing and community engagement. I earned my Ph.D. in Systems Engineering from the University of Virginia in 2019 and have an undergraduate background in Industrial Engineering.
