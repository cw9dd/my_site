I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin focusing on mobile sensing for mental health. I provide research and data analytics expertise for UTâ€™s [Whole Communities Whole Health](https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/whole-communities-whole-health/) grand challenge initiative, a multidisciplinary task force between engineering and behavioral sciences specialized in health sensing and community engagement. 

My work deepens our understanding of and helps improve human health and behavior using ubiquitous information technology and data science methods. I contribute to research areas such as Ubiquitous Computing, Human-Computer Interaction, Smart and Connected Health, and Computational Social Systems.
